                <p>Weâ€™re very careful about the massage therapists we select to join the Soothe network. We interview all of our therapists in person and make sure they are fully licensed and insured in their state of practice. We accept only the highest quality therapists with a history of excellence in customer satisfaction.</p>
                <p>In most states, including California, the process to become a certified massage therapist (CMT) requires applicants to successfully pass background checks conducted by a state investigator, before being deemed able to safely work with the public. All Soothe massage therapists have passed these government sponsored certification measures.</p>
                <p>All Soothe massage therapists have the highest level of integrity and professionalism. In return, we expect all clients to reciprocate the same level of respect and conduct. (In Canada, all of our therapists are experienced professionals, however, not all are RMTs).</p>
